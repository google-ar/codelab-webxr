        This is an experiment using augmented reality features with the WebXR Device API.
        Upon entering AR, you will be surrounded by a world of cubes.
        Learn more about these features from the <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr">Building an augmented reality application with the WebXR Device API</a> Code Lab.
